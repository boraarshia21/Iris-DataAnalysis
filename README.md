# Iris Dataset Analysis  

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Model Training** on the classic **Iris Dataset**, implemented in **Google Colab**.  

# Overview  
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning, containing 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

This notebook walks through:  
1. Loading and exploring the dataset.  
2. Preprocessing the data.  
3. Performing EDA with summary statistics and visualizations.  
4. Training a simple machine learning model.  

# Features  
- Data preprocessing: cleaning and preparing the dataset.  
- EDA: statistical summaries, correlation analysis, and visualizations.  
- Visualizations: pair plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.  
- Model training: applying ML algorithms for classification.
